# Fractional Order Delayed Differential Equations

In real world systems, delay is very often encountered in many practical systems, such as automatic control, biology and hydraulic networks, economics and long transmission lines. The delayed differential equation is used to describe these dynamical systems. Fractional order delayed differential equations as the generalization of the delayed differential equations, provide more freedom when we describing these systems, let's see how we can use FractionalDiffEq.jl to accelerate the simulation of delayed differential equations.
