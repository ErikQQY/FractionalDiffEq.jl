# FractionalDiffEq.jl

Hello thereðŸ‘‹!

FractionalDiffEq.jl is a Julia package aiming at solving Fractional Differential Equations using high performance numerical methods.

## Installation

If you have already installed Julia, you can install FractionalDiffEq.jl in REPL using Julia package manager:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalDiffEq.jl:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq#master
```

## Features

1. While most fractional differential equations solvers are implemented using Matlab, **FractionalDiffEq.jl** is totally driven by [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and licensed with [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), ensure its everlasting development and open source.

2. Benefit from the advancing features of JuliaLang, FractionalDiffEq.jl has impressing performance and high speed, help the model more efficient and robust.

3. Capable of solving both linear and nonlinear fractional differential equations.

4. Detailed models supporting, such as Bagley Torvik equations, Relaxation Oscillation equation etc.
