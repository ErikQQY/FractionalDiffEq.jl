!!! tip "Star Us"
	If you think **FractionalDiffEq.jl** is useful and powerful, please [star us in GitHub](httpd://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalDiffEq.jl), it means a lot to us!

## Installation

If you have already installed Julia, you can install FractionalDiffEq.jl in REPL using Julia package manager:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalDiffEq.jl:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq#master
```

## Features

* While most fractional differential equations solvers are implemented using Matlab, **FractionalDiffEq.jl** is totally driven by [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and licensed with [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), ensure its everlasting development and open source.

* Benefit from the advancing features of JuliaLang, FractionalDiffEq.jl has impressing performance and high speed, help the model more efficient and robust.

* Capable of solving both linear and nonlinear fractional differential equations.

* Detailed models supporting, such as Bagley Torvik equations, Relaxation Oscillation equation etc.
