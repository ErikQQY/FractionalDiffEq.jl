# FractionalDiffEq.jl

Hello thereðŸ‘‹!

FractionalDiffEq.jl is a Julia package aiming at solving Fractional Differential Equations using high performance numerical methods.

```@contents
Pages = ["index.md"]
```

## Installation

If you have already installed Julia, you can install FractionalDiffEq.jl in REPL using Julia package manager:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalDiffEq.jl:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq#master
```

## Features

1. While most fractional differential equations solvers are implemented using Matlab, **FractionalDiffEq.jl** is totally driven by [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and licensed with [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), ensure its everlasting development and open source.

2. Benefit from the advancing features of JuliaLang, FractionalDiffEq.jl has impressing performance and high speed, help the model more efficient and robust.



## Roadmap
