# Get Start

We would use the simple example -- [Relaxation Oscillation Process](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillation) example to show you how to use FractionalDiffEq.jlðŸ™‚

The mathematical model of the Relaxation Oscillation can be abstracted as IVP:

```math
D^{1.8}y(t)+y(t)=1,\ (t>0)
```

```math
y^{(k)}(0)=0
```

While we can know the analytical solution of this equation is:

```math
u(t)=t^{1.8}E_{1.8,\ 2.8}(-t^{1.8})
```

Here ``E_{\alpha, \beta}(z)`` is the [Mittag Leffler function](https://scifracx.org/FractionalDiffEq.jl/stable/mittagleffler/).

We can solve this problem by the following code using FractionalDiffEq.jl:

```julia
using FractionalDiffEq, Plots
fun(u, p, t) = 1-u
Î±=1.8; h=0.01; tspan = (0, 20); u0 = [0, 0]
prob = SingleTermFODEProblem(fun, Î±, u0, tspan)
sol = solve(prob, h, PECE())
plot(sol)
```

By plotting the numerical result, we can get the approximation result:

To provide users a simple way to solve fractional differential equations, we follow the design pattern of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl)

## Step 1: Defining a Problem

First, we need to specify the problem we want to solve. Just by passing the parameters â€”â€” describing function, orders, initial condition and time span:

```julia
using FractionalDiffEq
fun(u, p, t) = 1-u
Î± = 1.8; u0 = [0, 0]; tspan = (0, 20); h = 0.01;
prob = SingleTermFODEProblem(fun, Î±, u0, tspan)
```

The ```SingleTermFODEProblem``` is a class of fractional differential equation, describing equations with ``D^{\alpha}u=f(t, u)`` pattern. For other patterns and classes of fractional differential equation, please refer to [Problem types](@ref problems)

## Step 2: Solving a Problem

After defining a problem, we can solve it by calling the ```solve``` function:

```julia
sol = solve(prob, h, Alg())
```

Note that there are different algorithms for differential fractional differential equations, such as FODE, FPDE, FDDE and FIE, we need to choose a suitable algorithm for specific problem. For all the algorithms, please refer to [algorithms documentation](@ref algorithms).

## Step3 : Analyzing the Solution

Simply call plot to visualize the solution:

```julia
using Plots
plot(sol)
```
