# Distributed Order Differential Equations

We integrate ``{_0D_t^\alpha f(t)}`` with respect to the order, we can obtain distributed-order differential/integral equations. Since we normally adopted the notation as:

```math
{_0D_t^{\omega(\alpha)} f(t)} := \int_{\gamma_1}^{\gamma_2}\omega(\alpha){_0D_t^\alpha f(t)}d\alpha
```

We can write the general form of distributed order differential equations as:

```math
\int_0^m \mathscr{A}(r,\ D_*^r u(t))dr = f(t)
```
