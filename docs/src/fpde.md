# Fractional Order Partial Differential Equations

Several models of physical and biological processes are better described using fractional PDEs than the corresponding integer-order PDEs. They serve as a generalization of the integer-order PDEs and give some degree of freedom in varying the rate of change of these physical and biological processes.
