# Fractional Order Chaos Gallery

> These examples come from [Fractional-Order Nonlinear Systems](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-18101-6), and can serve as companions to reproduce these well known fractional order chaotic systems in Julia.

FractionalDiffEq.jl also has impressive capability for solving Nonlinear system of FODEs:
